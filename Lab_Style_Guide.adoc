= GPTE Lab Style Guide

// Following the suggestion from https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#applying-substitutions
:markup-in-source: verbatim,attributes,quotes
// and then use it as:
//[source,java,subs="{markup-in-source}"] 

== Why Style Guide?

We want to have consistent style across our labs.

Our labs usually include: 
* shell commands and their output
* YAML files
* short code examples, including Jenkins pipelines
* Instruction steps (do this, analyze the results, then do that)
* Explanation of the topic (plain text, sometimes with questions to the reader)

The purpose of common style is to reduce friction for the learners. 
We want to eliminate uncertainty in the instruction and make a clear distinction between the elements: 
commands to type on the keyboard, parameters to replace with customer values, output to expect and analyse, etc.

This Style Guide should follow the existing rules and de-facto rules as much as possible. 
Namely, we are going to use as a basis the following sources:

* Red Hat Style Guide: http://stylepedia.net/style/
* IBM Style Guide: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/styleguidelines/index.html and https://www.amazon.com/IBM-Style-Guide-Conventions-Writers/dp/0132101300 
* O'Reilly style guide: http://oreillymedia.github.io/production-resources/styleguide/  


== Shell commands and their output

=== Shell commands mentioned inside the text

*IBM* and *Red Hat* guides: use *`monospaced bold`* when you mention a command inside plain text.
For example:

To access this database server we need a PostgreSQL client. Install it with the *`yum`* command:

*O'Reilly* guide: use `monospaced normal` when you mention a command inside plain text.
For example:

To access this database server we need a PostgreSQL client. Install it with the `yum` command:


=== Shell commands that the student has to type

*IBM* and *Red Hat* guides: use `monospaced normal` when you show the command that the student should type
on the keyboard.
For example:

[source,sh,"{markup-in-source}"]
----
# yum install postgresql
----

*O'Reilly* guide: use *`monospaced bold`* when you show the command that the student should type
on the keyboard.
For example:

[source,sh,"{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *yum install postgresql*
----

=== Shell prompt

Shell prompt is used to:

* Signal that this is a command that the student should type and separate it from the command output
* Signal the difference between commands entered as normal user and commands entered as `root`. 

*Red Hat*: `$` for normal users, `#` for root. No hostname or user name.

*IBM*: not specified.

*O'Reilly*: `$` for normal users, `#` for root. No hostname or user name. 
In some recent books (_Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes_) no shell prompt at all.


=== Shell command parameters that the student has to replace

Sometimes the student should replace some parameters with her specific values.
*IBM*, *Red Hat*, *O'Reilly* use _`monospaced italic`_ for that. 
Example:

[source,sh,"{markup-in-source}"]
----
# *oc get pod _pod-name_ -o yaml*
----


Embedded help in the `oc` command uses `CAPS` for that.

=== Command output


=== YAML files


=== Instruction steps
